# Product Context: Triangler & Visualizer

**Problem:** 
1. Users may want to use the geometric data (triangle coordinates and colors) generated by the low-poly conversion process for other applications beyond just the static image output.
2. Visualizing the generated triangles in an interactive 3D space can offer better understanding and potential for creative applications (like animations).

**Solution:** 
1. Modify the `triangler` tool to optionally output triangle data in a structured format (JSON).
2. Create a separate frontend web application using React and Three.js to load this JSON data and render the triangles interactively in 3D.

**How it Works:**

*   **Backend (`triangler`):**
    *   Performs edge detection, point sampling, and Delaunay triangulation.
    *   If `--format json` is specified, calculates triangle colors and saves vertex coordinates and colors to a JSON file (`data.json`).
*   **Frontend (`frontend/`):**
    *   Runs as a local web application (using Vite).
    *   Fetches `data.json` from its `public` directory.
    *   Uses `@react-three/fiber` to create a Three.js scene.
    *   Renders each triangle from the JSON data as a `Mesh` with the correct geometry and color.
    *   Provides orbit controls for navigating the 3D scene.
    *   Includes `leva` debug controls for real-time parameter adjustment.

**User Experience:**

*   **Backend:** Users run the Python tool with `--format json` to generate data.
*   **Frontend:** Users run `npm run dev` in the `frontend` directory and open the provided URL in a browser to see an interactive 3D representation of the triangulated image. They can orbit the camera and use debug controls.
