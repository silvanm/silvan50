# Active Context: Frontend Visualization Setup

**Current Focus:** Building a frontend application using React and Three.js to visualize the triangle data generated by the `triangler` Python tool.

**Recent Changes:**

1.  **Project Setup:**
    *   Created `frontend/` directory.
    *   Initialized a React + TypeScript project using Vite.
    *   Installed core dependencies: `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`.
    *   Installed debug UI library `leva` (using `--legacy-peer-deps` due to React 19 conflict).
    *   Resolved initial TypeScript/JSX setup issues.
2.  **Data Loading & Rendering:**
    *   Modified `frontend/src/App.tsx` to fetch `data.json` from the `/public` directory.
    *   Implemented a `TriangleMesh` component to render individual triangles based on loaded data (coordinates and color).
    *   Displayed all triangles in the scene.
3.  **Camera & View:**
    *   Initially used an orthographic camera for a 2D view.
    *   Switched to a perspective camera for a 3D view.
    *   Adjusted initial camera position and `OrbitControls` target for a usable 3D perspective.
    *   Applied a 90-degree rotation to the group containing the triangles as requested (though this was later reverted by user edits).
4.  **Debugging:**
    *   Integrated `leva` controls using the `useControls` hook.
    *   Added controls for ambient/directional lighting and the main triangle group's position/rotation.
    *   Moved `useControls` hook calls to the top of the component to fix linting errors.

**Next Steps:**

*   Implement animation for the triangles.
*   Refine camera controls and initial view if needed.
*   Potentially improve lighting for better 3D effect.
*   Consider how to update Leva control defaults dynamically after data loads (currently uses placeholders).
