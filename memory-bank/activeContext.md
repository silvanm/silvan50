# Active Context: Triangle Slideshow Package Improvements

**Current Focus:** Enhancing the slideshow transition functionality with triangle standardization and rebuilding the frontend from scratch.

**Recent Changes:**

1. **Code Restructuring:**
   * Reorganized all code into a clean Python package structure (`triangle_slideshow/`)
   * Created three main modules:
     * `processor.py`: Handles image processing with triangler
     * `transition.py`: Creates transitions between slides using the Hungarian algorithm
     * `slideshow.py`: Manages the slideshow data structure
   * Implemented a single entry point (`create_slideshow.py`) for all functionality
   * Enhanced JSON format to support multiple slides in a sequence

2. **Triangle Standardization Feature:**
   * Implemented the `standardize_triangle_counts` method in the `Slideshow` class
   * Designed a system to add invisible "dummy triangles" (opacity=0) to slides with fewer triangles
   * Added position copying logic to borrow coordinates from adjacent slides for dummy triangles
   * Fixed bug in the position copying implementation and aligned tests with actual behavior
   * Verified the dummy triangle functionality works correctly for all test cases
   * Added diagram showing how standardization fits into the workflow

3. **Round-Robin Transitions Feature:**
   * Implemented a new `round_robin_transitions` method in the `Slideshow` class
   * Added support for creating circular transitions (1→2→3→1) that loop back to the first slide
   * Added a new command-line option (`--round-robin`) in `create_slideshow.py`
   * Created comprehensive tests for the feature, including end-to-end testing
   * Verified functionality with actual image processing
   * Simplified the system by focusing on just two modes: Sequential (default) and Round-Robin

4. **Testing Improvements:**
   * Added unit tests for all core functionality
   * Implemented end-to-end tests that verify the entire process flow
   * Added specific tests for the new standardization and round-robin features
   * Created test fixtures with sample triangle data for consistent testing

5. **Virtual Environment Integration:**
    * Modified `process_folder.py` to use the Python virtual environment in `triangler_dir/venv`
    * Added detection of virtual environment paths for cross-platform compatibility
    * Fixed issues with importing the triangler module and its dependencies
    * Successfully processed images using the local triangler package instead of requiring global installation

6. **Documentation Updates:**
    * Added a comprehensive workflow diagram (`workflow_diagram.md`) showing the complete system architecture
    * Updated the diagram to include the triangle standardization feature
    * Documented the relationships between all components and processing steps

7. **Frontend Removal:**
    * Deleted the entire frontend implementation to prepare for a rebuild from scratch
    * Will be building a new frontend with improved architecture and better transition support
    * New frontend will properly utilize the standardized triangle counts for smoother transitions

8. **CLI Default Argument Changes (`create_slideshow.py`):**
    * `--round-robin` and `--split` are now enabled by default. Use `--no-round-robin` and `--no-split` to disable.
    * Input directory defaults to `images/`.
    * Output directory defaults to `silvan50frontend/public/data/`.
    * Points for triangulation (`--points`) defaults to `2000`.

9. **Initial Black Slide Implementation (`create_slideshow.py`):**
    * The script now automatically prepends a black slide named `"000_black_intro_slide"` as the first slide.
    * This slide uses the geometry of the last processed image, with all colors (triangles and dominant color) set to black (`#000000`).
    * This provides a fade-in effect for the slideshow.

10. **Test Suite Adjustments:**
    * Tests in `test_end_to_end.py` and `test_slideshow.py` were updated to align with:
        * The new dictionary structure returned by image processing functions (includes `dominant_colors`).
        * The new JSON serialization format where transitions are nested within each slide object.
    * All tests are currently passing after these adjustments.

**Next Steps:**

* Build new frontend from scratch with support for the standardized triangle transitions, including the initial black slide.
* Optimize the Hungarian algorithm for large triangle sets (currently limited by memory usage)
* Consider adding support for more triangle processing options (edge detection methods, sampling algorithms)
* Add more sophisticated triangle matching algorithms beyond centroid distance
* Consider implementing a CLI tool for more direct use without scripting
