# Active Context: Triangle Slideshow Package Improvements

**Current Focus:** Enhancing the slideshow transition functionality with round-robin capabilities and restructuring the codebase for better maintainability.

**Recent Changes:**

1. **Code Restructuring:**
   * Reorganized all code into a clean Python package structure (`triangle_slideshow/`)
   * Created three main modules:
     * `processor.py`: Handles image processing with triangler
     * `transition.py`: Creates transitions between slides using the Hungarian algorithm
     * `slideshow.py`: Manages the slideshow data structure
   * Implemented a single entry point (`create_slideshow.py`) for all functionality
   * Enhanced JSON format to support multiple slides in a sequence

2. **Round-Robin Transitions Feature:**
   * Implemented a new `round_robin_transitions` method in the `Slideshow` class
   * Added support for creating circular transitions (1→2→3→1) that loop back to the first slide
   * Added a new command-line option (`--round-robin`) in `create_slideshow.py`
   * Created comprehensive tests for the feature, including end-to-end testing
   * Verified functionality with actual image processing
   * Simplified the system by focusing on just two modes: Sequential (default) and Round-Robin

3. **Testing Improvements:**
   * Added unit tests for all core functionality
   * Implemented end-to-end tests that verify the entire process flow
   * Added specific tests for the new round-robin transitions feature
   * Created test fixtures with sample triangle data for consistent testing

4. **Virtual Environment Integration:**
    *   Modified `process_folder.py` to use the Python virtual environment in `triangler_dir/venv`.
    *   Added detection of virtual environment paths for cross-platform compatibility.
    *   Fixed issues with importing the triangler module and its dependencies.
    *   Successfully processed images using the local triangler package instead of requiring global installation.

5. **Batch Processing Improvements:**
    *   Simplified batch processing with a cleaner API in the `triangle_slideshow` package
    *   Enhanced slideshow serialization with proper JSON structure
    *   Improved error handling and reporting during image processing

6. **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Added a comprehensive workflow diagram (`workflow_diagram.md`) showing the complete system architecture
    *   Highlighted the round-robin transitions feature in the diagram
    *   Documented the relationships between all components and processing steps

**Next Steps:**

*   Optimize the Hungarian algorithm for large triangle sets (currently limited by memory usage)
*   Consider adding support for more triangle processing options (edge detection methods, sampling algorithms)
*   Enhance frontend integration to support round-robin transitions in the visualization
*   Add more sophisticated triangle matching algorithms beyond centroid distance
*   Consider implementing a CLI tool for more direct use without scripting
