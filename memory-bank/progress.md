# Progress: Triangler Enhancements & Frontend Visualization

## Backend (`triangler` Python tool)

**What Works:**

*   Core triangulation functionality (edge detection, sampling, Delaunay, image rendering).
*   Command-line interface for basic configuration (input/output image, points, algorithms).
*   **New:** Option to output triangle coordinates and colors as a JSON file via `--format json`.
*   **New:** CLI correctly parses the `--format` argument and passes it to the core `convert` function.
*   **New:** The `convert` function correctly handles both `image` and `json` output formats.
*   **New:** JSON file saving logic is implemented.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

*   Thorough testing of the JSON output with different images, renderers (centroid/mean), and configurations.
*   Validation of the coordinate and color data accuracy in the generated JSON files.
*   Updating project documentation (README) to include the new `--format` option and JSON output description.

**Current Status:**

*   JSON output feature is implemented in `converter.py` and exposed via `__main__.py`.
*   Basic command-line execution errors have been fixed.
*   Ready for testing and validation.

**Known Issues:**

*   None currently identified related to the new feature, pending testing.

## Frontend (`frontend/` React App)

**What Works:**

*   Basic project setup with Vite, React, TypeScript, Three.js, R3F.
*   Fetching `data.json` containing triangle data.
*   Rendering triangles from JSON data onto a flat plane in 3D space.
*   Perspective camera setup with appropriate initial view.
*   OrbitControls for interactive camera manipulation (orbit, zoom, pan).
*   Leva debug UI integration for controlling lighting and group transforms.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

*   Implement triangle animation.
*   Refine initial camera position/zoom and lighting for optimal viewing.
*   Test with different `data.json` files (various sizes, triangle counts).
*   Address potential performance issues with a very large number of triangles.
*   Consider dynamically updating Leva defaults based on loaded data.

**Current Status:**

*   Frontend application is set up, loads data, renders triangles in 3D, and includes debug controls.
*   Ready to implement animation features.

**Known Issues:**

*   `leva` installation required `--legacy-peer-deps` due to incompatibility with React 19, potentially leading to subtle issues (though none observed yet).
