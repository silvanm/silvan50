# Progress: Triangler Enhancements & Frontend Visualization

## Backend (`triangler` Python tool)

**What Works:**

*   Core triangulation functionality (edge detection, sampling, Delaunay, image rendering).
*   Command-line interface for basic configuration (input/output image, points, algorithms).
*   **New:** Option to output triangle coordinates and colors as a JSON file via `--format json`.
*   **New:** CLI correctly parses the `--format` argument and passes it to the core `convert` function.
*   **New:** The `convert` function correctly handles both `image` and `json` output formats.
*   **New:** JSON file saving logic is implemented.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

*   Thorough testing of the JSON output with different images, renderers (centroid/mean), and configurations.
*   Validation of the coordinate and color data accuracy in the generated JSON files.
*   Updating project documentation (README) to include the new `--format` option and JSON output description.

**Current Status:**

*   JSON output feature is implemented in `converter.py` and exposed via `__main__.py`.
*   Basic command-line execution errors have been fixed.
*   Ready for testing and validation.

**Known Issues:**

*   None currently identified related to the new feature, pending testing.

## Batch Processing & Transition Generation

**What Works:**

*   `process_folder.py` script for batch processing multiple images.
*   Generation of triangle JSON files for each input image.
*   Creation of transition files between all pairs of images using the Hungarian algorithm.
*   Automatic generation of a default `combined_data.json` file for frontend use.
*   Shell script (`process_images.sh`) for simplified command-line usage.
*   Copying generated files to the frontend's public directory.
*   Separation of concerns with triangler module vs. local triangler directory.
*   Using the virtual environment in `triangler_dir/venv` for all dependencies.
*   **New:** Complete codebase restructuring into a clean Python package structure.
*   **New:** Single entry point (`create_slideshow.py`) for all processing.
*   **New:** Round-robin transitions feature for creating circular slideshows (1→2→3→1).
*   **New:** Command-line option (`--round-robin`) for creating cyclical slideshows.
*   **New:** Simplified transition system with just two modes: Sequential (default) and Round-Robin.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

*   Performance optimization for large triangle sets.
*   Better error handling for triangler command failures.
*   Support for additional parameters like edge detection methods and sampling algorithms.
*   More sophisticated triangle matching algorithms beyond centroid distance.

**Current Status:**

*   Batch processing pipeline is functional using the virtual environment in `triangler_dir/venv`.
*   Transition generation works and produces valid JSON files.
*   Integration with the frontend is implemented and working.
*   Direct output to frontend/public directory is supported for immediate visualization.
*   **Updated:** Code has been restructured into a modular Python package (`triangle_slideshow/`).
*   **Updated:** Comprehensive test suite implemented, including end-to-end tests.
*   **Updated:** Round-robin transitions feature verified with actual images.

**Known Issues:**

*   Memory usage concerns with the Hungarian algorithm on large triangle sets.
*   Potential path issues on different operating systems.

## Frontend (`frontend/` React App)

**What Works:**

*   Basic project setup with Vite, React, TypeScript.
*   **Updated:** Replaced Three.js with SVG for 2D rendering of triangles.
*   **Updated:** Using GSAP for smooth animations of triangle elements.
*   **Updated:** Fetching triangle data from `data2.json` in public folder.
*   Rendering triangles from JSON data in SVG elements.
*   **New:** Triangle animation with random positions and rotations.
*   **New:** 90-degree clockwise rotation applied to the entire triangle group.
*   Leva controls for animation parameters, group transformations, and appearance.
*   Loading of the default transition from `combined_data.json`.
*   Selection of different transitions from a dropdown menu.
*   Support for directory listing of available transition files.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

*   Test with different triangle data files (various sizes, triangle counts).
*   Address potential performance issues with a very large number of triangles.
*   Consider adding more complex animation patterns or interaction capabilities.
*   Handle window resizing and responsive layout adjustments.
*   Improve the UI for transition selection and display.

**Current Status:**

*   Frontend application is fully functional with SVG+GSAP implementation.
*   Triangle animations are working with controls for duration and distance.
*   Application works with Node.js v18.20.6 environment.
*   Support for loading and transitioning between multiple triangle sets implemented.

**Known Issues:**

*   Vite v6.3.2 has compatibility issues with Node.js versions newer than v18.
*   Error `SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression flags` occurs when using newer Node.js versions.
*   Must use `nvm use 18` to switch to Node.js v18 before running the frontend.
*   SVG approach may have performance limitations with extremely large numbers of triangles compared to WebGL, but offers simpler implementation.
*   No direct integration with the backend - relies on manual file copying.
