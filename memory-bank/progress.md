# Progress: Triangler Enhancements & Slideshow Generation

## Backend (`triangler` Python tool)

**What Works:**

*   Core triangulation functionality (edge detection, sampling, Delaunay, image rendering).
*   Command-line interface for basic configuration (input/output image, points, algorithms).
*   **New:** Option to output triangle coordinates and colors as a JSON file via `--format json`.
*   **New:** CLI correctly parses the `--format` argument and passes it to the core `convert` function.
*   **New:** The `convert` function correctly handles both `image` and `json` output formats.
*   **New:** JSON file saving logic is implemented.
*   **New:** Triangle standardization feature ensuring all slides have the same number of triangles.
*   **New:** Intelligent position copying for dummy triangles from adjacent slides.
*   **New:** Default CLI arguments for common use cases in `create_slideshow.py` (input/output dirs, points, split output, and round-robin transitions enabled by default).
*   **New:** Automatic prepending of a black intro slide (named `000_black_intro_slide`) by `create_slideshow.py` for a fade-in effect. This slide uses the geometry of the last processed image with all colors set to black.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

*   Thorough testing of the JSON output with different images, renderers (centroid/mean), and configurations.
*   Validation of the coordinate and color data accuracy in the generated JSON files.
*   Updating project documentation (README) to include the new `--format` option and JSON output description.
*   Performance optimization for large triangle sets.
*   Better error handling for triangler command failures.
*   Support for additional parameters like edge detection methods and sampling algorithms.
*   More sophisticated triangle matching algorithms beyond centroid distance.
*   Ensure test suite for `create_slideshow.py` (main function) adequately covers behavior with new CLI defaults and the automatic black intro slide.

**Current Status:**

*   JSON output feature is implemented in `converter.py` and exposed via `__main__.py`.
*   Basic command-line execution errors have been fixed.
*   Ready for testing and validation.
*   Batch processing pipeline is functional using the virtual environment in `triangler_dir/venv`.
*   Transition generation works and produces valid JSON files with transitions nested per slide.
*   **Updated:** Code has been restructured into a modular Python package (`triangle_slideshow/`).
*   **Updated:** Comprehensive test suite implemented, including end-to-end tests. Test suite adjusted for new processor output structure and nested transition serialization; all tests currently pass.
*   **Updated:** Round-robin transitions feature verified with actual images.
*   **Updated:** Triangle standardization feature implemented and all tests passing.

**Known Issues:**

*   None currently identified related to the new feature, pending testing.
*   Memory usage concerns with the Hungarian algorithm on large triangle sets.
*   Potential path issues on different operating systems.
