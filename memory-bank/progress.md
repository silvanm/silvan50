# Progress: Triangler Enhancements & Slideshow Generation

## Backend (`triangler` Python tool)

**What Works:**

*   Core triangulation functionality (edge detection, sampling, Delaunay, image rendering).
*   Command-line interface for basic configuration (input/output image, points, algorithms).
*   **New:** Option to output triangle coordinates and colors as a JSON file via `--format json`.
*   **New:** CLI correctly parses the `--format` argument and passes it to the core `convert` function.
*   **New:** The `convert` function correctly handles both `image` and `json` output formats.
*   **New:** JSON file saving logic is implemented.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

*   Thorough testing of the JSON output with different images, renderers (centroid/mean), and configurations.
*   Validation of the coordinate and color data accuracy in the generated JSON files.
*   Updating project documentation (README) to include the new `--format` option and JSON output description.

**Current Status:**

*   JSON output feature is implemented in `converter.py` and exposed via `__main__.py`.
*   Basic command-line execution errors have been fixed.
*   Ready for testing and validation.

**Known Issues:**

*   None currently identified related to the new feature, pending testing.

## Batch Processing & Transition Generation

**What Works:**

*   `process_folder.py` script for batch processing multiple images.
*   Generation of triangle JSON files for each input image.
*   Creation of transition files between all pairs of images using the Hungarian algorithm.
*   Automatic generation of a default `combined_data.json` file for frontend use.
*   Shell script (`process_images.sh`) for simplified command-line usage.
*   Copying generated files to the frontend's public directory.
*   Separation of concerns with triangler module vs. local triangler directory.
*   Using the virtual environment in `triangler_dir/venv` for all dependencies.
*   **New:** Complete codebase restructuring into a clean Python package structure.
*   **New:** Single entry point (`create_slideshow.py`) for all processing.
*   **New:** Round-robin transitions feature for creating circular slideshows (1→2→3→1).
*   **New:** Command-line option (`--round-robin`) for creating cyclical slideshows.
*   **New:** Triangle standardization feature ensuring all slides have the same number of triangles.
*   **New:** Intelligent position copying for dummy triangles from adjacent slides.

**What's Left to Build/Verify:**

*   Performance optimization for large triangle sets.
*   Better error handling for triangler command failures.
*   Support for additional parameters like edge detection methods and sampling algorithms.
*   More sophisticated triangle matching algorithms beyond centroid distance.

**Current Status:**

*   Batch processing pipeline is functional using the virtual environment in `triangler_dir/venv`.
*   Transition generation works and produces valid JSON files.
*   **Updated:** Code has been restructured into a modular Python package (`triangle_slideshow/`).
*   **Updated:** Comprehensive test suite implemented, including end-to-end tests.
*   **Updated:** Round-robin transitions feature verified with actual images.
*   **Updated:** Triangle standardization feature implemented and all tests passing.

**Known Issues:**

*   Memory usage concerns with the Hungarian algorithm on large triangle sets.
*   Potential path issues on different operating systems.

## Frontend Visualization

**What Works:**

*   ~~Basic project setup with Vite, React, TypeScript.~~
*   ~~SVG for 2D rendering of triangles.~~
*   ~~GSAP for smooth animations of triangle elements.~~
*   ~~Fetching triangle data from JSON in public folder.~~
*   ~~Rendering triangles from JSON data in SVG elements.~~
*   ~~Triangle animation with random positions and rotations.~~
*   ~~Leva controls for animation parameters, group transformations, and appearance.~~
*   ~~Loading of transitions from JSON files.~~
*   ~~Selection of different transitions from a dropdown menu.~~

**What's Left to Build:**

*   **Everything!** The frontend has been deleted and will be rebuilt from scratch.
*   Create new React application with better architecture.
*   Implement triangle rendering with SVG or Canvas.
*   Build animation system that utilizes the standardized triangle counts.
*   Create user interface for controlling transitions and animations.
*   Implement support for both sequential and round-robin transitions.
*   Add loading of triangle data from the slideshow JSON files.

**Current Status:**

*   The previous frontend implementation has been deleted.
*   Planning to rebuild with improved architecture and better transition support.
*   Backend is generating properly standardized triangle data ready for a new frontend.

**Known Issues:**

*   No frontend currently exists - this will be the next focus area.
