# Project Intelligence: Triangler & Transitions

## Environment & Compatibility

- The local directory named `triangler_dir` is distinct from the Python module named `triangler`.
- The triangler module is required for image processing and is available in a local virtual environment.
- The virtual environment in `triangler_dir/venv` contains all required dependencies for triangler.
- Process scripts require Python 3.6+ with NumPy and SciPy installed.
- The frontend requires EXACTLY Node.js v18 (not v20+) due to Vite compatibility issues.
- Use `nvm use 18` to switch to the correct Node.js version before running the frontend.

## Command Patterns

### Image Processing

- Process a single image with triangler:
  ```bash
  ./triangler_dir/venv/bin/python -m triangler /path/to/image.jpg -p 1000 -o output/image.json --format json
  ```

- Process a folder of images and create transitions:
  ```bash
  ./process_folder.py --input-dir images/ --output-dir output/ --points 1000 --create-transitions
  ```

- Process images directly to the frontend public directory:
  ```bash
  ./process_folder.py --input-dir images/ --output-dir frontend/public/ --points 1000 --create-transitions
  ```

- Process images and serve the frontend:
  ```bash
  ./process_images.sh --input images --output output --points 1000 --serve
  ```

### Frontend Server

- Start the frontend development server (ensure correct Node.js version first):
  ```bash
  nvm use 18
  cd frontend && npm run dev
  ```

### Transition Generation

- The Hungarian algorithm is used for finding triangle pairings between images.
- Transition generation has a memory limit, defaulting to 5000 triangles per image.
- The first transition generated becomes the default `combined_data.json` file.
- Transitions are stored in the `transitions/` subdirectory of the output directory.

## File Structure

- Individual triangle JSON files are stored in the output root directory.
- Transition files use the naming pattern `{image1}_to_{image2}.json`.
- The frontend expects `combined_data.json` as the default transition file.
- For the frontend, files should be in `frontend/public/` and `frontend/public/transitions/`.

## Performance Considerations

- The Hungarian algorithm's O(nÂ³) complexity makes it memory-intensive for large triangle sets.
- Each transition file contains both sets of triangles plus the pairings between them.
- The SVG frontend may struggle with extremely high triangle counts (thousands).
- Creating transitions between all pairs of N images results in N*(N-1)/2 transition files.

## Troubleshooting

- If using the virtual environment doesn't work, make sure the path in `process_folder.py` is correct.
- The virtual environment in `triangler_dir/venv` contains all required dependencies including `skimage`.
- If no transitions are created, check that at least two images were successfully processed.
- Frontend errors usually relate to missing or malformatted JSON files or paths.
- If frontend transitions don't work, check for the existence of `combined_data.json`.
- If frontend fails with `SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression flags`, ensure you're using Node.js v18 with `nvm use 18`.
